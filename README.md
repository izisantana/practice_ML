# Machine Learning Classification with KNN, SVM, PCA, and KPCA

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning algorithms for classification tasks using the Iris Dataset. The project covers the application of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification, as well as dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA).

## Features

- **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)**: Classifies samples based on the classes of the nearest neighbors.
- **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**: Finds the optimal hyperplane for classification.
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: Reduces data dimensionality for better visualization and interpretation.
- **KPCA (Kernel Principal Component Analysis)**: Extends PCA to capture non-linear patterns.
